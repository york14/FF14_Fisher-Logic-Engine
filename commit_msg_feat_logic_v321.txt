- Implemented integral-based expected value calculation for cases where lure constraint intersects with bite time distribution.
- Updated result table to show "Min ~ Max" instead of "Avg ± Range" for clarity.
- Added calculation type details to debug view.
- Spec: docs/reference/spec_update_wait_time_calc.md
